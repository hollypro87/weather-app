This is a weather app using the open weather api, bootstrap, moment, and jquery.

There is a search function to look for weather in your selected city.
With every search, the previous search will save for you to reference at a later time.
There is the capability to clear searches if you no longer want to see your previous searches.

When a search is complete, you will see the current weather for your selected location.
